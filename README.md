## freedom now
 - what we thought would happen vs. what happened 
 - how we adapted - phone, home visits, paper scrapbook
 - in the end, personal connections made the difference
 - the *real goal* of the project was to get names, not to do a crowdsourcing project "if they don't want to give us names online, i'll go to their house."
 - awc acting as researcher - not goal of lib'ship but goal of project
     + went to f'ville 2x
 - made a scrapbook for VCUL employee to take to choir practice

via AWC:

> We began in the usual fashion: letters, email, social media, and all kinds of publicity. Getting the word out so folks would come via the internet and participate in our crowdsourcing project. We imagined long strings of comments identifying protesters.

> Then the phone calls started. And we realized that people were looking at the project, but not commenting. And this caused us to change our plans.

> The primary goal of the project was to GET NAMES. To identify participants in these protests. The primary goal was not to do a digital crowdsourcing project.

> SO, we set up meetings at the library. We came in after hours to meet folks after they got off work. We went to people’s houses and sat down with our laptops, paper and pen. One VCU Libraries’ staff member arranged for her cousins to come stay at her house so we could interview them.

> We went to Farmville and the Moton Museum to meet people (no internet access, so took sample pix on an iPad). We created a scrapbook that would travel to choir practice at a Prince Edward County church.  We drove to Farmville a second time and took the scrapbook to someone who would carry it to an NAACP anniversary event.

> In the end it was the personal connections that made the difference. This was not a program that would succeed without library personnel sitting down and getting to know people. Building trust. Being grateful. Letting them be in the spotlight, not us.

### why was this project unique?

 - SCALE
 - SPEED
 - our ability to connect with a great number of people through THEIR connections, not our own. 
 - the fact that it started digital made it faster
 - longevity - supreme court used photo in exhibit in spring 2016. If it were physical exhibit only, it wouldn't have had a continued life.
 - ability to go back and forth between digital and physical
 - ability to link out to other institutions 

# takeaways

The goal is *meaning*, not method.
