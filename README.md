# [Making The Invisible Visible: Diversity, Dialogue And Multicultural Awareness Through Digital Projects](http://ndlc.info/program/sessions/Making-the-Invisible-Visible-Diversity,-Dialougue-and-Multicultural-Awareness-Through-Digital-Projects)

**Original pitch, Basic gist of session:** we’re giving a rundown of Freedom Now and Klan map. We’ll talk about how they came about, but more importantly how we got them out to the public: 

 - what our goals were for developing these projects: spreading message of inclusion
 - who we targeted and why as we developed the site; 
considerations for design and language; 
 - who we talked to during and after the project was complete; 
 - how we introduced the projects to the world; 
 - how we engaged in dialogue around the project; 
 - how we worked with the press; 
 - how the projects transformed after we released them; and 
 - how we triaged feedback and used it to improve the projects after release

**Combined pitch:** Librarians from the Virginia Commonwealth Libraries, United States and York University/Osgoode Hall Law School Libraries, Canada have developed digital projects to build awareness about racial discrimination, religious persecution and multicultural communities. This combined presentation discusses the unique ways digital projects help us expand the library/librarians' role in stimulating widespread, meaningful dialogue, historical awareness, and preservation and promotion of indigenous knowledge to diverse audiences.

## freedom now project

In 1954, the Supreme Court of the United States issued its landmark [Brown vs. Board of Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education) decision, which declared that separate facilities for black and white students were inherently unequal. The court ordered the states to desegregate their schools "with all deliberate speed."

In early 1956, Virginia state senator Harry F. Byrd vowed to unite a network of white politicians in Virginia to prevent public school desegregation, in a widespread, far-reaching campaign called Massive Resistance.

In 1959, as part of the ongoing Massive Resistance campaign, Prince Edward County, Va. closed its public schools to all students rather than desegregate them. Private "segregation academies" that only enrolled white students sprung up to replace the public schools. Black students had few options but to leave or to attend volunteer-run Free Schools.

By 1963, four years after schools had closed, the African-American community in Farmville had waited long enough. It was time for a Program of Action: a series of protests and organized boycotts of businesses in downtown Farmville.

VCU Libraries' Freedom Now Project is a digital collection of photos from Farmville civil rights protests in the summer of 1963. 

The photographs were taken for and by the Farmville police department as part of surveillance efforts, and as such, demonstrators are often seen reacting to the camera and the photographer, revealing some of the emotional and psychological tension present during this period of non-violent civil dissent. 

These images are evocative and raw. And when we were given these photos, we wanted to find out who these brave protesters were so that their work could be honored. Thus, the Freedom Now project was born. 

### digital and analog, coming together

Goal of the project: digital crowdsourcing Identifying people
Technical part: easy. Non-technical part: very difficult
Our assumptions vs. what actually happened


We began in the usual fashion: letters, email, social media, and all kinds of publicity. Getting the word out so folks would come via the internet and participate in our crowdsourcing project. We imagined long strings of comments identifying protesters.

> Then the phone calls started. And we realized that people were looking at the project, but not commenting. And this caused us to change our plans.

> The primary goal of the project was to GET NAMES. To identify participants in these protests. The primary goal was not to do a digital crowdsourcing project.

### pivoting midway

Personal connections - not ours but the community’s
Trust-building, relationship-building, being grateful, shining the spotlight
This started as a digital project but grew into something larger.


> SO, we set up meetings at the library. We came in after hours to meet folks after they got off work. We went to people’s houses and sat down with our laptops, paper and pen. One VCU Libraries’ staff member arranged for her cousins to come stay at her house so we could interview them.

> We went to Farmville and the Moton Museum to meet people (no internet access, so took sample pix on an iPad). We created a scrapbook that would travel to choir practice at a Prince Edward County church.  We drove to Farmville a second time and took the scrapbook to someone who would carry it to an NAACP anniversary event.

> In the end it was the personal connections that made the difference. This was not a program that would succeed without library personnel sitting down and getting to know people. Building trust. Being grateful. Letting them be in the spotlight, not us.

### why was this project unique?

 - SCALE
 - SPEED
 - our ability to connect with a great number of people through THEIR connections, not our own. 
 - the fact that it started digital made it faster
 - longevity - supreme court used photo in exhibit in spring 2016. If it were physical exhibit only, it wouldn't have had a continued life.
 - ability to go back and forth between digital and physical
 - ability to link out to other institutions 

## mapping the second ku klux klan, 1915-1940

In late 2014, a VCU history professor emailed us a 50-page word document listing all the known Ku Klux Klan chapters that were formed across the United States between the two world wars, 1915 or so to 1940. This document was the culmination of 30 years of research in dark archives and Klan newspapers. "Can you do anything with this?" our professor asked. We jumped at the opportunity.

Over the next year, the library's web team worked closely with our faculty expert, normalizing the data to populate a geographic timeline of the Klan's spread, giving us deeper insight into this research and also into American culture in the first half of the 20th century. The first Klan of Reconstruction and the third Klan of the Civil Rights era were both concentrated in the Deep South, but the second Klan spread across the United States. That tells us that parts of the Klan’s appeal — not just racism, but also anti-Semitism and anti-Catholicism — were widespread as "American values."

What we ended up with - and what we knew could gain widespread attention - was a highly visual, provocative interactive map.

### social/cultural considerations

We took this project on in the midst of, and in conversation with, the larger social and cultural context in America, in the South, in Richmond and at VCU. 
 - When we began working on the project in January 2015, the #blacklivesmatter movement was gaining momentum across the U.S. following the police shooting of Michael Brown. 
 - In June as the project truly began to take form, Dylann Roof shot nine black people in their church in Charleston, South Carolina. 
 - In the fall, as we planned the launch for the site, cities across the South, including Richmond, were reckoning with the lingering remnants of the confederacy. 
 - And a week before we planned to launch the site, black VCU students staged a sit-in at the University President's office, demanding a better living and learning environment, and spurring two forums on inclusion and racial diversity at VCU.

All of these things happened as we worked on this project. And we could not ignore them. In fact, they informed our work. 

Knowing that no software or digital project is neutral, we consciously designed the system to share the facts at hand but to also use them to start discussion. 

To me, the most opinionated design decision for the site was the default use of geolocation, which shows visitors Klan activity in their own geographic area first. So, for example, a visitor from Illinois sees their own state dotted with red points indicating local chapters of the klan popping up over time. For most visitors in the continental U.S., this is a compelling graphic that says: "discrimination was everywhere then just as it is now." If visitors choose to stay longer on the site, they are able to zoom out and see the widespread appeal of the Klan across the continental U.S. (and Alaska and Panama!). 

We designed the site assuming that it would have widespread interest. We also assumed that 90% of visitors would be on the page for 90 seconds or less - to perhaps read the introductory popup and view the animation. For the 10% of visitors who wanted to spend more time, the site also offers more information, links to resources, and questions for further exploration.

As part of the appeal to widespread audiences, we took care to keep the writing as simple but informative as possible. I worked closely with our faculty member to bring the text from a 17th-grade reading level to a 6th-grade reading level. By making the text less academic-ese, a greater diversity of users across ages and reading levels, as well as people who were simply in a hurry, could easily understand the website and the phenomenon of the Second Klan. 

In designing for widespread audiences, we also built in features such as an animated GIF of the map for sharing, as well as special metadata for Twitter and Facebook to create rich, easily shareable links. We also created a mobile version of the map, which, though not as functional, quickly conveys the gist of the site's story in a powerful way.

Beyond the technical aspects, for the site's launch we also considered our VCU and Richmond communities, holding an in-person forum after the launch to talk about the research and the modern-day cultural echoes of the Klan. About 50 people came to this forum on a weekday in December, at the end of the semester, which is remarkable in itself and indicates how important this real-life outreach was.

This forum was part of a larger plan that we'd developed with our library and university communications teams. We all knew the project would hold wide interest and thought it was important to situate it in the context of current events. So we were proactive, reaching out to media in the region to let them know about the story. 

### how it went

The response to the project after we launched was overwhelming. We not only were VCU's most popular tweet of the year; our project also made the front page of the Richmond Times-Dispatch, got attention on Virginia public radio, and netted us news coverage from across the U.S. We heard from researchers all over, from a full professor in Germany to a curious teenager in Palo Alto. It's clear that the site resonated with many people. And it's still out there, getting us the occasional tweetstorm or news article.
