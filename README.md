**Abstract:** Librarians from the Virginia Commonwealth Libraries, United States and York University/Osgoode Hall Law School Libraries, Canada have developed digital projects to build awareness about racial discrimination, religious persecution and multicultural communities. This combined presentation discusses the unique ways digital projects help us expand the library/librarians' role in stimulating widespread, meaningful dialogue, historical awareness, and preservation and promotion of indigenous knowledge to diverse audiences.

## [Freedom Now Project](http://go.vcu.edu/freedomnow)

In 1954, the Supreme Court of the United States issued its landmark [Brown vs. Board of Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education) decision, which declared that separate facilities for black and white students were inherently unequal. The court ordered the states to desegregate their schools "with all deliberate speed."

In early 1956, Virginia state senator Harry F. Byrd vowed to unite a network of white politicians in Virginia to prevent public school desegregation, in a widespread, far-reaching campaign called Massive Resistance.

In 1959, as part of the ongoing Massive Resistance campaign, Prince Edward County, Va. closed its public schools to all students rather than desegregate them. Private "segregation academies" that only enrolled white students sprung up to replace the public schools. Black students had few options but to leave or to attend volunteer-run Free Schools.

By 1963, four years after schools had closed, the African-American community in Farmville had waited long enough. It was time for a Program of Action: a series of protests and organized boycotts of businesses in downtown Farmville.

VCU Libraries' Freedom Now Project is a digital collection of photos from Farmville civil rights protests in the summer of 1963. 

The photographs were taken for and by the Farmville police department as part of surveillance efforts, and as such, demonstrators are often seen reacting to the camera and the photographer, revealing some of the emotional and psychological tension present during this period of non-violent civil dissent. 

These images are evocative and raw. And when we were given these photos, we wanted to find out who these brave protesters were so that their work could be honored. Thus, the Freedom Now project was born. 

### digital and analog, coming together

The technology component of this project was perhaps the easiest. Once our scanning unit processed the 500 or so photographs, we assigned some minimal metadata (which still required significant sleuthing on our metadata librarian's part). The images were then loaded into ContentDM, our local digital collections repository. This photo collection went live sometime in 2012, with the idea that we'd launch a future crowdsourcing campaign to name the unknown protesters.

By 2013 we'd taken on a project manager for this initiative (Alice Campbell, co-author of this presentation in absentia). Alice gave the project its name - Freedom Now - and set about culling the best photos for a Flickr photoset. 

So, we spun up a Flickr account, created a web page with information about the project, and set our PR machine on high, reaching out to various media outlets and social media contacts. Our idea was to drive traffic to Flickr and encourage people to comment on the photos if they had information on who was in the photos or where they were taken. We imagined long strings of comments identifying protesters.

Then, after a local TV news program picked up the story, the phone calls started. And we realized that the people we wanted to hear from were looking at the project, but not commenting. These people were by now in their 60s, 70s, and 80s, and had no interest in creating a Flickr account just to comment (even though we included explicit instructions on how!) In hindsight, this makes a great deal of sense.

So we changed our plans. The primary goal of the project was not to "do a digital crowdsourcing proejct" - the purpose was to get names, to identify participants in these protests. It was crowdsourcing the original way.

### pivoting midway

Once we realized our original plan wouldn't work, Alice pivoted and took a different angle. She set up meetings at the library. She came in after hours to meet folks after they got off work. She went to people’s houses and sat down with a laptop, paper and pen. One VCU Libraries’ staff member arranged for her cousins to come stay at her house so they could be interviewed.

**Digital to physical:** Alice went in person to Farmville and the local Moton Museum to meet people - with no internet access, she simply brought sample photos on an iPad. With printouts of those photos, Alice created a scrapbook that would travel to choir practice at a Prince Edward County church. Later she drove to Farmville a second time and took the scrapbook to someone who would carry it to an NAACP anniversary event.

**Personal connections:** The project began as a digital-only project, which gave it the legs it needed to reach a wider audience. But in the end it was Alice's outreach and growing network of personal connections that made the difference. This was not a program that would succeed without library personnel sitting down and getting to know people. Building trust. Being grateful. Letting them be in the spotlight, not us. 

This started as just a digital project, but became a very real point of connection for a small community in Virginia. 

### project outcomes

We are still understanding the outcomes of this project. 

**For the world:** The images are all online for the world to see, to help gain a better understanding of the civil rights movement in America, in Virginia, and in Prince Edward County. These images join many other collections of images taken during this volatile time in American history. We are proud to be able to share this collection. Most recently, a photo from this collection hung in the Supreme Court of Virginia as part of a spring 2016 exhibit.

**For Farmville:** The effect in Farmville is a community that has another part of its story. Several works - memoirs, history books, journal articles - have told the Farmville story. This is yet another view and a primary source for community members and scholars.

**For individuals:** All told, our personal connections in Farmville identified at least 80 people in these photographs. Some people are still with us, while others have passed away. Some of the people were relatives of VCU Libraries employees. Some were students from New York that we identified from SUNY Library's web project on this topic. 

**For VCU Libraries:** Stories were unearthed. And, we learned about our community, tried to surface their stories, and helped piece together a 50-year-old story. The connections we made and lessons learned from putting this project together are invaluable. They also connect deeply with the community-engaged mission of the University and the library.

## [Mapping the Second Ku Klux Klan, 1915-1940](http://go.vcu.edu/mappingtheklan)

In late 2014, a VCU history professor emailed us a 50-page word document listing all the known Ku Klux Klan chapters that were formed across the United States between the two world wars, 1915 or so to 1940. This document was the culmination of 30 years of research in dark archives and Klan newspapers. "Can you do anything with this?" our professor asked. We jumped at the opportunity.

Over the next year, the library's web team (primarily our web developer, Shariq Torres) worked closely with our faculty expert, normalizing the data to populate a geographic timeline of the Klan's spread, giving us deeper insight into this research and also into American culture in the first half of the 20th century. The first Klan of Reconstruction and the third Klan of the Civil Rights era were both concentrated in the Deep South, but the second Klan spread across the United States. That tells us that parts of the Klan’s appeal — not just racism, but also anti-Semitism and anti-Catholicism — were widespread as "American values."

What we ended up with - and what we knew could gain widespread attention - was a highly visual, provocative interactive map.

### social/cultural considerations

We took this project on in the midst of, and in conversation with, the larger social and cultural context in America, in the South, in Richmond and at VCU. 
 - When we began working on the project in January 2015, the #blacklivesmatter movement was gaining momentum across the U.S. following the police shooting of Michael Brown. 
 - In June, while the project truly began to take form, nine black people were murdered in their church in Charleston, South Carolina. 
 - In the fall, as we planned the launch for the site, cities across the South, including Richmond, were reckoning with the lingering remnants of the confederacy. 
 - And a week before we planned to launch the site, black VCU students staged a sit-in at the University President's office, demanding a better living and learning environment, and spurring two forums on inclusion and racial diversity at VCU.

All of these things happened as we worked on this project. And we could not ignore them. In fact, they informed our work. 

Knowing that no software or digital project is neutral, we consciously designed the system to share the facts at hand but to also use them to start discussion. 

**Geolocation:** To me, the most opinionated design decision for the site was the default use of geolocation, which shows visitors Klan activity in their own geographic area first. So, for example, a visitor from Illinois sees their own state dotted with red points indicating local chapters of the klan popping up over time. For most visitors in the continental U.S., this is a compelling graphic that says: "discrimination was everywhere then just as it is now." If visitors choose to stay longer on the site, they are able to zoom out and see the widespread appeal of the Klan across the continental U.S. (and Alaska and Panama!). 

**The 90/10 rule:** We designed the site assuming that it would have widespread interest. We also assumed that 90% of visitors would be on the page for 90 seconds or less - to perhaps read the introductory popup and view the animation. For the 10% of visitors who wanted to spend more time, the site also offers more information, links to resources, and questions for further exploration.

**6th-grade reading level:** As part of the appeal to widespread audiences, we took care to keep the writing as simple but informative as possible. I worked closely with our faculty member to bring the text from a 17th-grade reading level to a 6th-grade reading level. By making the text less academic-ese, a greater diversity of users across ages and reading levels, as well as people who were simply in a hurry, could easily understand the website and the phenomenon of the Second Klan. 

**Shareability:** In designing for widespread audiences, we also built in features such as an animated GIF of the map for sharing, as well as special metadata for Twitter and Facebook to create rich, easily shareable links. We also created a mobile version of the map, which, though not as functional, quickly conveys the gist of the site's story in a powerful way.

**Real-life outreach:** Beyond the technical aspects, for the site's launch we also considered our VCU and Richmond communities, holding an in-person forum after the launch to talk about the research and the modern-day cultural echoes of the Klan. About 50 people came to this forum on a weekday in December, at the end of the semester, which is remarkable in itself and indicates how important this real-life outreach was.

**PR plan:** This forum was part of a larger plan that we'd developed with our library and university communications teams. We all knew the project would hold wide interest and thought it was important to situate it in the context of current events. So we were proactive, reaching out to media in the region to let them know about the story. 

### how it went

The response to the project after we launched was overwhelming. We not only were VCU's most popular tweet of the year; our project also made the front page of the Richmond Times-Dispatch, got attention on Virginia public radio, and netted us news coverage from across the U.S. We heard from researchers all over, from a full professor in Germany to a curious teenager in Palo Alto. It's clear that the site resonated with many people. And it's still out there, getting us the occasional tweetstorm or news article.
